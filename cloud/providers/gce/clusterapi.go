                fixed automatically over time (like service outages), but instead
                indicate that something is fundamentally wrong with the MachineTemplate's
                spec or the configuration of the machine controller, and that manual
                intervention is required. Examples of terminal errors would be invalid
                combinations of settings in the spec, values that are unsupported
                by the machine controller, or the responsible machine controller itself
                being critically misconfigured.  Any transient errors that occur during
